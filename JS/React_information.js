// React js: It is JS library which used to devlope UI appliction. It is worked as an component based structure as well as support Typescript.

// What is TypeScript => Typescript is subset of JS. It is use to temletting your application.
// In JS developement most of time we miss out some functionality and definations. Like undefine scenario or type casted scenario means if any value will get undefined after compilation the typescript will catch it before compilaion. Within your development. It will worked based on the interface way. 
// Interface is an object structure where we can pre define their value type. 

// example of interface =>

/*interface empdetails {
    Id: number,
    Name: String,
    Email: String,
    Phonen: Number

}*/

// Typescript will understand object properties and there type also. It will not allow any diff type to that perticular object.
